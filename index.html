          On a turn, a player rolls the die 🎲 repeatedly. The goal is to
          accumulate as many points as possible, adding up (hold) the numbers
          rolled on the die 🎲. However, if a player rolls a 1, the player's
          turn is over and any points they have accumulated during this turn are
          forfeited. Rolling a 1 doesn't wipe out your entire score from
          previous turns, just the total earned during that particular roll. A
          player has to choose to hold (stop rolling the die 🎲) if they do not
          want to take a chance of rolling a 1 and losing all of their points
          from this turn. If the player chooses to hold, all of the points
          rolled during that turn are added to his or her score. When a player
          reaches a total of 100 points, the game ends and that player is the
          winner.</p>
